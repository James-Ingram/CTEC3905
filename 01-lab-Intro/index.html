    <h2>Workshops</h2>
  
    <p>Location: see your personal timetable</p>
    <p>One 2-hour workshop per week (see timetable above).</p>

    <p>Practical workshops involve semi-taught lab exercises and hands-on coding, and are a focussed place to work on your assignments and develop practical skills. Attending all workshops will ensure that you keep up with the learning outcomes and work towards your individual project assignment (see below for details). Students who attend regularly tend to produce higher-quality work and gain better marks.</p>

    <p><strong>Your attendance at workshops counts towards the ongoing viva (10% of the final module mark). A module-wide weekly evaluation will help track and personalise the learning experience.</strong></p>

    <p>Work submitted without sufficient attendance may not meet the required standard, so could be rejected, and code is <strong>always</strong> examined for plagiarism.</p>
  
    <h2>Lectures</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Bede Island 0.05</p>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> Tuesdays 16:00-18:00</p>
  
    <p>Ten 2-hour lectures, every week (see timetable above).</p>
  
    <p>Lectures complement the practical workshops and cover essential technical issues as well as the wider perspectives on front-end web technologies. They also contain carefully-selected links for deeper information. You will learn to make intelligent choices and predict future industry trends in this rapidly-changing and complex field.</p>
  
    <h2>Module details</h2>
  
    <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
  
    <p>By the end of this module, through attendance and participation in workshops, and after successful completion of lab tasks and assignments, students will be able to:</p>
  
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Contextualise and critique the aims and culture driving current web technologies, how these have evolved and what part they play in modern web development.</li>
      <li>Develop a critical understanding of basic design principles, Information Architecture (IA), usability principles and semantic markup, and how these determine navigability, usability and website/webapp structure.</li>
      <li>Demonstrate evidence of a detailed understanding of the current front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and make intelligent choices regarding their use and context.</li>
      <li>Create a fully standards-compliant, responsive and accessible website using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</li>
    </ol>
	
	<p>In addition, best practice in general software development (e.g. version control, consistent code indentation, etc.) will be encouraged throughout the module. These will also be part of the marking criteria for the final project.</p>
    
	<h3>Blackboard resources</h3>
	
	<p>Blackboard is a crucial part of this module, so take some time to read through the material there—it contains:</p>

        <li>Is the site responsive? If so, where are the breakpoints and how are they used?</li>
        <li>Is the navigation effective or is some content hard to find? can you identify any usability issues or errors?</li>
        <li>Is the source code readable and well-structured?</li>

	<h2>University policy</h2>
	
	<h3>Anonymous marking</h3>
	
	<p>Because of the practical nature of this module, there will be no anonymous marking, as the origin of each students’ work is obvious to the tutors from workshop sessions.</p>
	
	<h3>Late work</h3>
	
	<p>This will be penalised according to university rules and regulations. These rules also apply to work submitted after a <em>14-day extension deadline</em> authorised by the Module Tutor/Leader.</p>

      <dl>
	    <dt>Coursework received after 2.00pm on the deadline date</dt>
          <dd><em>without an agreed extension</em> will be stamped ‘late’ and marked down accordingly. The centre (FOTAC) will close promptly at the published times, so work cannot be accepted until 9.00am on the following working day.</dd>
        <p> </p>
		<dt>Coursework submitted within 7 days from the deadline</dt>
          <dd><em>without prior permission from the Module Tutor/Leader</em> will be subject to a cap of <strong>40%</strong></dd>
	    <p> </p>
		<dt>Coursework submitted later than 7 days after the deadline</dt>
          <dd><em>with no prior notice</em> will receive a mark of <strong>0%</strong>.</dd>
	  </dl>
	  
    <h3>Extensions</h3>
	
	<p>These may be granted for significant reasons (e.g. health issues, serious family problems, etc.) They <strong>cannot</strong> be granted for bad the management, pressure from other module deadlines, minor illness, etc.</p>

	<h3>Deferrals, failure and reassessment</h3>

    <p>In very exceptional circumstances, a deferral may be granted.</p>

    <p>If you are judged to have failed the course, contact your workshop tutor as soon as possible for advice on what practical work to undertake in order to resubmit for reassessment, and when studio facilities will be available, if required.</p>

    <h3>Plagiarism (using work from other sources)</h3>
	
	<p>Before you write anything, read the DMU library page "<a href="http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14#f1">What is plagiarism</a>". As for copying code, developers often examine source code from other sites and adapt features they like into their own work. However, pre–designed templates that entire designs, copying tutorials mindlessly, or taking code wholly or substantially from other sources is not acceptable for assessments, as you will learn very little. So always explain <em>if and how</em> you have adapted any third-party code or online tutorials and examples to demonstrate that you understand what you’re doing.</p>

    <p>The practical work submitted for this course must be your own, so be aware that tutors know how to check source code in detail. The essay will be submitted via Turnitin, which highlights copied text.</p>

    <p><strong>For further information</strong>, please refer to the student regulations on the <a href="http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/student-regulations.aspx">DMU website</a>.</p>
